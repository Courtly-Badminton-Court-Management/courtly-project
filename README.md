## 🎯 Background

In Thailand, most badminton courts still rely on **phone calls** or **Facebook Page DMs** for bookings.  
This causes problems such as:
- Slow back-and-forth communication
- Uncertainty about availability
- Double bookings
- Scattered proof of payment

For venue managers, this leads to **high manual workload** and **limited visibility** into demand patterns.

---

## 👥 Stakeholders

- **Players (End-users):** Want to view, and book available courts.  
- **Court Managers/Owners:** Manage schedules, pricing, availability, and payments.

---

## 🚀 MVP Scope (Single Club)

- Month/Day availability view
- Booking slot (multi-slot selection)
- Cancellation with CL Coin refund policy
- CL Coin top-up via slip (manager approval)
